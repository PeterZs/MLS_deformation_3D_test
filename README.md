This figure is the result of deformation of mesh based on coarse cage. The left: the original mesh, the middle: the deformation result
by as-rigid-as-possible energy and the right: the  deformation result by moving least square method extending the paper Image Deformation Using Moving Least Squares to 3D. Both are added with the same constraints.
