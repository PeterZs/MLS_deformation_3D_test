# MLS_deformation_3D_test
The 3D moving least square deformation result in the 3rd column of the corresponding figure in gallery. 

Deform mesh based on coarse cage and use as-rigid-as-possible energy or moving least square method
extending the paper Image Deformation Using Moving Least Squares to 3D.
